            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3 id="paragraph__title"><b><em>  Did this year go as expected?</em></b> </h3>
                <p id="paragraph__content">Real Madrid’s 2021 did not begin well. January brought an embarrassing Copa del Rey exit against third-tier Alcoyano and limp defeat to Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Supercopa. <u>In La Liga, Zinedine Zidane’s tired-looking champions fell 10 points distant of runaway leaders Atletico Madrid</u>.

                    From there, things started to pick up. Making the Champions League semi-finals, where they lost to eventual winners Chelsea, was a decent showing. Recovering in La Liga to push Atletico right to the final round of games was also a more or less acceptable way to end the season. And things have gone quietly to plan in the first half of the current one under new/old coach Carlo Ancelotti.
                    
                    There have been wobbles, like losing to Sheriff Tiraspol in the Champions League and Espanyol in La Liga in the space of five early-autumn days. But Ancelotti and the team’s experienced core have got their act together impressively, and will end the year on a run of 11 wins from 12 which has pushed them clear at the top of La Liga and into the Champions League last 16 as one of the eight group winners.
                    
                    That is about as good a place to be over the winter break as anybody could have expected.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3 id="paragraph__title"><b><em>player of the year</em></b> </h3>
                <p id="paragraph__content">Karim Benzema had a tremendous 2021. Through the <u>0-0</u> against Cadiz 
                    at home on December 19, the day of his 34th birthday, he had hit 36 goals, his most ever in one 
                    calendar year. He then scored two more against Bilbao in Madrid’s final game before the break. There have 
                    also been 16 assists in all club competitions over the 12 months. The numbers do not do justice to 
                    Benzema’s influence on the team — the disappearance of other supposed galacticos such as 
                    Gareth Bale and Eden Hazard left him often carrying the attack pretty much on his own. A lot of the credit for Vinicius Junior emerging as
                    a bona fide star in recent months is also due to the Frenchman’s support on and off the pitch.</p>

                <h3 id="paragraph__title"><b><em>Moment of the year</em></b> </h3>
                <p id="paragraph__content">March’s Champions League quarter-final first leg victory over Liverpool was a huge result.
                     There had been concerns, or fears, ahead of the game, 
                     especially after injuries and COVID-19 positives meant a very patched-up defence.
                      But everything clicked into place. Toni Kroos and Luka Modric ran the midfield, 
                     <u> Vinicius gave Trent Alexander-Arnold a torrid time</u>,
                       and Eder Militao and Nacho confidently dealt with Liverpool’s fearsome attack.

                    The 3-1 victory was a reminder that Madrid may not be at the level of a few years back, but over 90 minutes could still more than match the very best teams around.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3 id="paragraph__title"><b><em>Worst Moment of the year</em></b> </h3>                <p id="paragraph__content">Not many around the Bernabeu will admit it, but the botched Super League launch in April was a disaster for Madrid’s reputation.

                    For many observers in Spain, club president Florentino Perez is a masterful manipulator of situations, a Machiavellian politician who always wins in the end.
                     But Perez’s appearance on tabloid TV show El Chiringuito de Jugones to defend the project was
                      a cringe-inducing 90 minutes full of alternative facts which did not hide that the whole thing was 
                      a humiliating failure.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3 id="paragraph__title"><b><em>Piece you most enjoyed writing</em></b></h3>
                <p id="paragraph__content">Often when researching an in-depth profile of a leading player, it can be difficult to get people who really know the subject to talk. Those close to the very biggest stars are often quite busy and hard to reach, especially if you want them to go on the record to share details about the more “difficult” characters at the top of the game.

                    However, this was not the case when putting together a long piece about Modric in March. Former team-mates from all through his career in Croatia, England and Spain, and even his neighbour in Madrid, Predrag Mijatovic, were more than happy to chat about a guy they obviously all love as a person and a player.
                    
                    You got to realise that, in football at least, sometimes the good guys really do win.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3 id="paragraph__title"><b><em>Goal of the year</em></b></h3>
                <p id="paragraph__content">With time almost up against Sevilla at the Bernabeu in late November, the scoreline was 1-1 and Madrid were under pressure from opponents who sensed a chance for a victory to throw the title race wide open. Then Militao hit a long ball out to Vinicius, who was by the sideline, and well covered by the well organised visiting defence. He chested the ball first time to wrong-foot Lucas Ocampos, raced past Gonzalo Montiel, and, without breaking stride, hit an absolute rocket to the far top corner from 25 yards.

                    It was completely unstoppable, either by the defence or the keeper, and reminiscent of Cristiano Ronaldo’s very best moments at the stadium. What a difference 11 months makes.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3 id="paragraph__title"><b><em>Dream January signing</em></b></h3>
                <p id="paragraph__content">Signing PSG’s Kylian Mbappe has been the dream of Perez and many at the Bernabeu for some time now.

                    Were Mbappe to actually publicly agree a pre-contract to join Madrid next summer ahead of those last-16 games against PSG, the narrative implications would go off the scale.</p>
